# 🧱 Divar Neighbors – Smart Local Service Add-on

**Divar Neighbors** is a smart add-on for the Divar platform designed to connect service requesters with nearby specialists based on their **location** and **skillset**.

---

## 📌 Project Idea

Imagine the electricity in your house goes out and you urgently need an electrician. Instead of searching online or making multiple calls, you simply post a request through Divar. Our system will automatically notify nearby electricians who can respond, connect, and help you directly.

This tool aims to speed up and localize service-based connections on the Divar platform — fast, relevant, and location-aware.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### For Service Providers (those posting service ads):
- A **new add-on button** appears in the "Service Ads" section of Divar.
- Clicking it leads to a page where the user can:
  - Select their city and neighborhood (e.g., Tehran, Tajrish)
  - Choose the exact location via a map (using frontend geolocation)
  - Submit the information via a button

### For Service Seekers (those needing a technician):
- On the Divar home page, click **Local Services**.
- You’ll be redirected to a new page with service categories like:
  - Refrigerator repair
  - Water heater repair
  - Air conditioner repair
- After selecting a service, a form will appear to collect:
  - Full name
  - City, neighborhood, full address
  - Exact location via map
- Clicking **Search for a Technician** will:
  - Automatically scan the area for available professionals
  - Send requests to matching service providers
  - If a provider accepts, both parties will be connected:
    - A chat screen is shown
    - Phone numbers are shared for direct contact

> If no providers are found in the selected area, a message will show:  
> “No technician found in the selected location.”
